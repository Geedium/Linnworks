🪢 Integrations

| Integration                  | Implemented |
|:-----------------------------|:------------|
| **Channel integration**      | ✔ `Channel` |
| **Shipping integration**     | ✔ `<Root>`  |

This package only includes **types** and **utilities** for the integrations.  
You must deploy your own application server and host it with your chosen service.  
You can obtain your application `id`, `secret`, and `token` from the [Linnworks Developer Portal](https://developer.linnworks.com/).

> You can import the integration and access all its exported types.

>
> const var: Channel.ExpectedType = Channel.ExpectedType.STRING;
> ```
